# Deployment Fixes for Resume Scorer

## Issues Identified

1. **CUDA Library Dependencies**:

    - Error: `libcudnn.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
    - Resolution: Completely disabled CUDA functionality and patched PyTorch to run in CPU-only mode.

2. **ONNX Runtime Installation Failure**:

    - Error: `Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement onnxruntime-cpu (from versions: none)`
    - Resolution: Modified build scripts to skip onnxruntime and fall back to PyTorch-only mode.

3. **Maturin Build Error**:

    - Error: `Could not build wheels for maturin, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects`
    - Resolution: Removed dependencies that require Rust/Cargo compilation.

4. **Hugging Face Connectivity Issues**:
    - Error: `We couldn't connect to 'https://huggingface.co' to load the files, and couldn't find them in the cached files.`
    - Resolution: Added retry logic and fallback methods for model downloads.

## Changes Made

1. **CUDA Disabling Implementations**:

    - Created a CUDA patch module (`cuda_patch.py`) that mocks the CUDA functionality
    - Added environment variables to disable CUDA: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `FORCE_CPU`, `NO_CUDA`
    - Created a startup script (`startup.sh`) to verify CUDA is disabled before starting the API
    - Installed a CPU-only version of PyTorch

2. **Minimal API Fallback Implementation**:

    - Created a minimal API implementation in `api/index.py` that doesn't depend on CUDA
    - Added fallback mechanisms in the server startup process
    - Created emergency minimal app if all else fails

3. **Modified `render-build.sh`**:

    - Explicitly uninstalled and reinstalled PyTorch in CPU-only mode
    - Added startup script that validates CUDA is disabled
    - Created a Python module that patches torch.cuda imports

4. **Updated Requirements Files**:

    - Removed problematic dependencies like onnxruntime
    - Added CPU-specific versions of libraries
    - Removed any CUDA-dependent packages

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
    - Added more robust error handling throughout the codebase
    - Created fallback mechanisms at every level
    - Added validation of environment configurations

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push these changes to your repository

2. In your Render dashboard:

    - Ensure the deployment uses the updated `render.yaml` with the startup script
    - Verify all environment variables are set to disable CUDA
    - Make sure the server starts with the `--fallback-to-cpu` and `--skip-onnx` flags

3. Deployment Sequence:
    - The build script (`render-build.sh`) will install CPU-only PyTorch
    - The startup script (`startup.sh`) will verify CUDA is disabled
    - If successful, the main API will start
    - If CUDA is still detected, a minimal emergency fallback API will start

## Monitoring After Deployment

After deployment, monitor these aspects:

1. Check if CUDA is properly disabled:

    - Look for logs showing "PyTorch CUDA available: False"
    - Verify no CUDA-related errors appear in logs

2. Verify the API is responding:

    - Use the health check endpoint (/health)
    - Check which mode the API is running in (normal, minimal, or emergency)

3. Monitor memory usage:
    - Ensure the application stays under Render's memory limits
    - Check for any out-of-memory errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **CUDA Detection Issues**:

    - Try using the minimal API implementation: edit `render.yaml` to set `startCommand: "python -m uvicorn api.index:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT --workers=1"`
    - Check the logs for any mentions of CUDA or GPU

2. **Memory Limit Issues**:

    - Reduce preloading of models by removing the `--preload-models` flag
    - Set `workers=1` to minimize memory usage

3. **Installation Failures**:
    - Try deploying without any model dependencies initially
    - Add them back one by one to identify problematic packages
