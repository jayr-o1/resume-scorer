# Resume Scorer

## About

Resume Scorer is an advanced AI-powered tool that analyzes resumes against job descriptions using natural language processing and semantic matching. The system helps recruiters and job seekers by providing objective assessments of how well a resume matches specific job requirements, offering visualization tools and actionable recommendations for improvement.

The platform combines AI, NLP, and data visualization to deliver accurate, consistent resume evaluations that eliminate human bias and increase efficiency in the hiring process. It supports both individual resume analysis and batch processing for recruitment teams.

## How It Works

1. **Text Extraction**: Enhanced PDF extraction with multiple fallback methods and language detection
2. **Skill Detection**: Context-aware skill detection using a custom skill ontology
3. **Semantic Matching**: Efficient semantic matching between resume and job requirements using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
4. **Visualization**: Generation of insights with interactive visualizations
5. **Recommendations**: Tailored improvement suggestions based on analysis results

## Performance Optimizations

Resume Scorer includes several optimizations to maximize performance and minimize resource usage:

1. **Model Quantization**: Optional 8-bit quantization reduces model size by up to 75% with minimal accuracy impact
2. **Task-Specific Models**: Specialized models for different tasks (skills, education, experience) improve both accuracy and efficiency
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines embedding models with rule-based extraction for optimal resource usage
4. **Memory Management**: Aggressive memory optimization with model offloading when not in use
5. **Pre-loading**: Models can be pre-loaded during startup for faster response times

These optimizations make Resume Scorer suitable for deployment on platforms with memory constraints, such as Render's free tier.

## Installation

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-scorer.git
cd resume-scorer

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download SpaCy model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run with performance optimizations
python run.py --mode web-local --use-quantization --task-specific-models --optimize-memory

# Or for the API server with all optimizations
python run_api.py --use-quantization --task-specific-models --preload-models
```

## Testing the Application

You can quickly test the core functionality using the provided test script:

```bash
python test_analyzer.py
```

This will analyze a sample resume against a software engineering job description and show the match percentage, skills match, experience assessment, and other key metrics. The full analysis results will be saved to `analysis_results.json` for detailed inspection.

## Deployment

### API Deployment to Render

The Resume Scorer API is ready for Render deployment with memory optimizations. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md) file.

Key optimizations for Render deployment:

-   **Model Quantization**: 8-bit quantized models reduce memory usage by up to 75%
-   **Task-Specific Models**: Different sized models for different tasks
-   **Rule-Based Components**: Non-ML approaches for suitable tasks (education/certification extraction)
-   **Offline Mode**: Pre-downloaded models prevent runtime downloads
-   **Memory Optimizations**: Advanced memory management for constrained environments

For deployment commands, see [RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Usage

### Streamlit Web Interface

The Streamlit interface provides three main tabs:

1. **Single Resume Analysis**:

    - Upload a resume PDF
    - Enter job details (summary, duties, skills, qualifications)
    - Get a comprehensive analysis with visualizations

2. **Batch Processing**:

    - Upload multiple resumes
    - Enter common job details
    - Compare and rank candidates

3. **Skill Ontology Management**:
    - View the skill ontology database
    - Add new skills with aliases and related skills

### REST API

The system provides a REST API that can be accessed with or without authentication:

```bash
# Analyze a resume (public endpoint)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze" \
  -F "resume=@path/to/resume.pdf" \
  -F "job_summary=Job summary text" \
  -F "key_duties=Key responsibilities" \
  -F "essential_skills=Required skills" \
  -F "qualifications=Required qualifications"

# List all skills
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/skills"

# Health check
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/health"

# Authenticated endpoints (require token)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/token" \
  -d "username=demo&password=password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

# Use the token for authenticated endpoints
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze/auth" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "resume=@path/to/resume.pdf" \
  -F "job_summary=Job summary text"
```

For more details on the API endpoints, request/response formats, and examples, see the [API_README.md](API_README.md) file.
